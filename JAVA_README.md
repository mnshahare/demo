Java program: src/Main.java

This is a minimal Java program that prints "Hello, world!" and optionally echoes command-line arguments.

Build and run (macOS / zsh):

1) Compile:

   javac src/Main.java -d out

2) Run:

   java -cp out Main

3) Run with args:

   java -cp out Main one two three

Notes:
- This creates an `out` directory with compiled classes.
- Requires Java (javac/java) installed and on PATH.
